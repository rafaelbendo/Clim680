This is my first draft for an assignment on Clim680.

Make a 12-panel plot of the climatology (1 panel for each month) of your data. If your data is not at a time frequency that allows monthly climatology, either choose individual times or a different aggregation (seasonal? year?). Make the plot look publication quality with titles, units, labels, good colorbar, continents, etc.
To submit your assignment:
•Create a repository on github.com for your assignment
•Upload your Jupyter Notebook
•Create 1 issue
•Describe one way you would improve your figure. There is always something to improve, so think critically about  what you could do to make it more clear, nicer, better suited to a particular medium, etc
Send an email to me with a link to your repository.
Due Thursday Oct 22 at 5pm
